# Employee Management Service using Spring Cloud and Microservices Architecture

This project is an Employee Management Service that utilizes Spring Cloud and follows a microservices architecture. It is built using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Hibernate, MySQL, and React.js for the frontend.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: The project is divided into separate microservices that interact with each other to perform various tasks.
  
- **Config Server**: Configuration data is stored in Git, ensuring easy management and versioning of the application configurations.

- **API Gateway**: The API Gateway centralizes and manages all microservice routes effectively, providing a unified entry point for the client application.

- **Service Registry**: Microservices are registered and managed using a Service Registry, enabling dynamic scaling and service discovery.

- **RabbitMQ**: RabbitMQ is used for auto-refresh and displaying real-time results to the users.

- **Frontend with React**: The project integrates a React frontend that provides a user-friendly display of employee data.
